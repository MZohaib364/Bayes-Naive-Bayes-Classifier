# Bayes and Naive Bayes Classifier on Iris Dataset (From Scratch)

This repository contains two Jupyter notebooks implementing **Bayes** and **Naive Bayes** classifiers from scratch using only **NumPy** and **Pandas** on the **Iris dataset**. Both implementations include a fully functional machine learning workflow with:

- Custom-built classifier classes  
- Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis  
- Implementation of **K-Fold Cross-Validation** for model evaluation  
- Performance metrics analysis (Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, etc.)

- ## Key Features

- **From Scratch Implementation:** No machine learning libraries used for modeling.  
- **K-Fold Cross-Validation:** Custom evaluation to ensure robust performance measurement.  
- **Detailed Analysis:** Performance comparison between Bayes and Naive Bayes classifiers.  
- **Modular Code:** Encapsulated logic using Python classes for reusability and clarity.
